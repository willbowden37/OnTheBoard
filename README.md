# Goodreads++  
Group On The Board's project for CS5890 at USU in Fall 2019  
Created by Will Bowden, Jason Andersen, and Joseph Turcotte  

Goodreads++ is a visualization of a book recommendation system. The main visualization is a hierarchical
edge bundling diagram created using D3 that links books that have been reviewed by the same users together.
The visualization was created from a modified version of data found in github user zygmuntz's repository
<a href="https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k">goodbooks-10k</a>. This repository contains data from
the Goodreads API.

The code for this project is primarily contained in the js directory, with the edge bundling code in particular
found in the BundledChart.js file. The data is contained in the data directory, where both the original
data and our preprocessed data is contained. The process book is found in proposal.md in the root directory.
