## Overview and Motivation
Our group loves to read books, but sometimes it is hard to find good books. 
Various people have made lists of the "bestbooks," but different people have different tastes. 
However, if you have similar tastes to someone in multiple categories, it is more likely that you might
like something else that that person does.  

The intent of this project is to create a visualization system that connects all kinds of books of
different genres according to who read and reviewed them. We accomplish this by using a Hierarchical Edge
Bundling visualization as well as a few others that supplement it. The goal of this is to make it easier to
find books that other people with similar tastes like as well. For example, if you like both Brandon
Sanderson and J.R.R. Tolkein, you could use this visualization to find other authors liked by people
who enjoy both of those authors.
